# Tableau-Mental-Health-Survey

Objectives/Business case/Goal of the project

Oasis is a growing advertising company in New York, U.S. that won a top 50 award for employee mental health in 2014. They want to target a top 10 award for employee mental health in 2015 so that they achieve an A-level global certification which will benefit them in many ways. They are very close to fulfilling the criteria. They want to know answers to very specific questions so that they can bring positive changes and implement better mental health practices in their company and potentially gain certification.

To answer questions such as:

1.	What is the general distribution of survey respondents?
2.	What is the general distribution of survey respondents diagnosed with mental conditions?
3.	Does remote working have better performance at work?
4.	How effective are the mental health benefits provided by the companies?
5.	Does the size of the company correlate with the negative consequences of discussing mental health with the employer?
6.	Who is more willing to discuss their mental condition with their supervisors?
